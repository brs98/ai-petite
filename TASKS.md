# Payment Flow Update Tasks

## Overview
Update the application to remove "no credit card required" messaging and implement a new payment flow:
1. Call to action button clicked
2. Redirected to page to choose plan
3. Plan chosen
4. Redirected to sign-up page with chosen plan in query params
5. Sign up happens
6. Redirected to stripe to checkout
7. After stripe checkout is completed, redirect to /profile

## Phase 1: Remove "No Credit Card Required" Text
- [x] Remove "No credit card required" text from main landing page (`app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` line 180)
- [x] Remove "No credit card required" text from login page (`app/(login)/login.tsx` line 168)
- [x] Search for any other instances of similar messaging across the codebase
- [x] Update any related copy that implies free usage without payment

## Phase 2: Update Call-to-Action Flow
- [x] Identify all CTA buttons on landing page that should redirect to plan selection
- [x] Update CTA button links to redirect to `/pricing` instead of sign-up
- [x] Ensure pricing page is accessible without authentication
- [x] Test that unauthenticated users can access pricing page

## Phase 3: Plan Selection Page Updates
- [x] Review current pricing page structure (`app/(dashboard)/pricing/page.tsx`)
- [x] Move pricing page outside of dashboard route group to make it publicly accessible
  - [x] Create new `app/pricing/` directory
  - [x] Move `page.tsx` and `submit-button.tsx` to new location
  - [x] Update any imports/references
- [x] Update plan selection buttons to redirect to sign-up with plan query params
- [x] Modify `SubmitButton` component to handle plan selection instead of direct checkout
- [x] Add plan parameter passing to sign-up URL (e.g., `/sign-up?plan=essential` or `/sign-up?plan=premium`)

## Phase 4: Sign-Up Page Updates
- [x] Update sign-up page to accept and display selected plan from query params
- [x] Show selected plan details on sign-up form
- [x] Store selected plan information during sign-up process
- [x] Update sign-up form validation to include plan selection
- [x] Modify sign-up success flow to redirect to Stripe checkout instead of dashboard

## Phase 5: Stripe Integration Updates
- [x] Update checkout action to handle plan from sign-up
- [x] Ensure user is created before Stripe checkout
- [x] Configure Stripe checkout success URL to redirect to `/profile`
- [x] Configure Stripe checkout cancel URL appropriately
- [x] Test Stripe webhook handling for successful payments

## Phase 6: Profile Page Creation
- [x] Create new `/profile` page (`app/profile/page.tsx`)
- [x] Design basic profile page layout with user information
- [x] Add subscription status display
- [x] Include basic account management features
- [x] Add navigation back to dashboard
- [x] Ensure profile page is protected (requires authentication)

## Phase 7: Navigation Updates
- [x] Update main navigation to include profile link
- [x] Update dashboard layout to include profile access
- [x] Ensure consistent navigation across authenticated pages
- [x] Update any breadcrumbs or page titles

## Phase 8: Testing & Validation
- [x] Test complete flow: Landing → Pricing → Sign-up → Stripe → Profile
- [x] Test with both Essential and Premium plans
- [x] Verify Stripe test payments work correctly
- [x] Test error handling (failed payments, cancelled checkout, etc.)
- [x] Test user experience on mobile devices
- [x] Verify all redirects work correctly
- [x] Test edge cases (direct URL access, back button behavior, etc.)

## Phase 9: Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [x] Handle case where user accesses sign-up without plan parameter
- [x] Add fallback for invalid plan parameters
- [x] Handle Stripe checkout failures gracefully
- [x] Add loading states for all transitions
- [x] Implement proper error messages for each step

## Phase 10: Documentation & Cleanup
- [x] Update README.md with new flow documentation
- [x] Add comments to new code following project conventions
- [x] Remove any unused code from old flow
- [ ] Update any relevant tests
- [ ] Document new environment variables if needed

## Technical Notes
- Follow project conventions from `BEST_PRACTICES.md`
- Use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Ensure all forms use Zod validation schemas
- Maintain consistent UI/UX with existing design system
- Use proper route protection middleware

## Success Criteria
- [x] No "no credit card required" text anywhere in the application
- [x] Complete payment flow works end-to-end
- [x] Users can successfully sign up and complete payment
- [x] Profile page displays correctly after successful payment
- [x] All error cases are handled gracefully
- [x] Mobile experience is optimized
- [x] Code follows project best practices and conventions
